          <h2>The web offers more rhetorical possibilities than ever imagined (Frobish, 2004).</h2>
          <p>Individuals and organizations can use the web as a means of establishing an online presence—an ethos—that conveys the sort of values they hold in common with the users they wish to attract to the site (Hunt, 1996). Enos and Borrowman refer to it as a <i>“techno-ethos”</i> (2001).</p>
          <p>To attract and retain audiences, an organization or individual must initiate trust between a website and user by communicating <strong>credibility</strong>.</p>
          <p>Trust would not be a factor online if a user did not think that engaging online was risky (Garbner-Krauter and Kaluscha, 2003), and trust afforded by credibility is vital in a medium (i.e., the web) that frustrates, angers, and annoys (Frobish, 2004).</p>

          <h4>Ethos has two components: credibility and character.</h4>

              <p>Traditionally, character refers to the speaker’s quality of person (or at least the quality she communicates) (Kinneavy and Warshauer). However, character can be assessed visually as well.<p>
