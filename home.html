          <h2>Ethos, interface, and credibility</h2>
          <p>Individuals and organizations can use the web as a means of establishing an online presence, or an <i>ethos</i>, that conveys the sort of values they hold in common with the users they wish to attract to the site (Hunt, 1996). Enos and Borrowman refer to this as a techno-ethos (2001).</p>
          <p>To attract and retain audiences, an organization or individual, via <i>ethos</i>, must initiate trust between themselves and a user by communicating credibility.</p>
          <p>Trust and credibility would not be a factor online if a user did not think that engaging online was risky (Garbner-Krauter and Kaluscha, 2003), and trust afforded by credibility is vital in a medium (i.e., the web) that frustrates, angers, and annoys (Frobish, 2004).</p>
          <p>According to Enos and Borrowman, <i>ethos</i> has two components credibility and character (2001). Traditionally, character refers to the speaker's quality of person (or at least the quality she communicates) (Kinneavy and Warshauer, 1994).</p>
          <p>However, character can be assessed visually as well.<p>

            <h3>Visual credibility</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="column-right">
            <p>Although the credibility of a website is distributed amongst several factors, a user's immediate, preliminary judgment is based off its surface, or visual, characteristics (Warnick, 2007). In reality, this preliminary glance is all a website gets: the average reader spends 15 seconds or less on a website (Hale, 2014).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section-three">
          <p>In a study examining how users assess the credibility of websites, users mentioned the "design look" more frequently than any other factor, including the website's accuracy of information (Fogg and Soohoo, 2003).</p>
          <p>Assessing the visual rhetoric of an interface is paramount in an era heavily influenced by the web and society's increased use and reception of computer graphics (Spalter and Van Damn, 2008). In fact, the visual interface may be a better sign of credibility than the author.</p>

        <div class="section-four">
          <h3>Issues with credibility</h3>
          <p>There can be any number of designers, writers, strategists, and programmers behind a website, so the authorship of a website is in question (Warnick, 2007). Although this seems less hazardous than an individual posing as someone else online, institutional-level manipulation online is a possibility, and it has far-reaching and potentially worse effects. Enos and Borrowman document a particularly haunting website--one that denies the Holocaust (2001):</p>

        <div class="case-study">
          <h3>The CODOH</h3>
          <p>The Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH) is a website dedicated to "promot[ing] intellectual freedom with regard to this one historical event [...] we have chosen to concentrate on the gas chamber stories and war crimes trials because they are emblematic of the allegedly unique monstrosity of the Germans before and after during World War II."</p>
          <p>CODOH's website is technically proficient--they construct a <i>techno-ethos</i> using parallel websites, pull down menus, graphics, and pleasing/accessible arrangements of text on the screen, but their cause is offensive to millions of people worldwide.</p>
          <p>On a surface level, they are credible. But their cause? Not so much.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-five">
          <p>Participants in the same study by Fogg and Soohoo did not mention the author as a component of the site's credibility, but interestingly, "company motive" was mentioned fourth most frequently (2003). Clearly, users understand that the interface can act as a mask; companies can dupe an audience by communicating a certain <i>ethos</i> via style even when it isn't true (Kinneavy and Warshauer, 1994). Users intuit the tension between author, motive, character, and credibility.</p>
          <p>This tension may contribute to why a user looks to "trust cues" other than the author, like the visual interface (Corritore, et al. 2001).</p>
